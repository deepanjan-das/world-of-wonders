            <div class="doc-heading">Project Overview</div>
            <div class="doc-text">This page is dedicated to an overview of the project "World of Wonders", a website, developed individually
                as part of the coursework for the CS5610 - Web Development course, under <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/rasala/" target="_blank">Professor Richard Rasala</a>. This course is part of my curriculum
                for the MS in Computer Science degree at Northeastern University, Boston.
            </div>
            <div class="doc-subheading">Objective</div>
            <div class="doc-text">The objective behind this website is to enable users to appreciate the cultural heritage of our common humanity and 
                explore such places and structures present around the world. <br />
                On a personal level, I have a passion for photography and exotic places, including those that have a rich history and significance. The 
                love of beautiful photographs and desire to visit amazing places led me to think about the World Heritage sites, and develop a web site 
                based on them.
            </div>
            <div class="doc-subheading">Functionalities</div>
            <div class="doc-text">
                The main functionalities of this website can be summarized as follows - 
                <ul>
                    <li>Ability to browse through some of the most popular World Heritage sites on Google Maps</li>
                    <li>Retrieve basic information about a WHS when a user clicks on a marker representing its location</li>
                    <li>To be able to view extended information about a WHS by accessing its Wikipedia link given on the site</li>
                    <li>Enjoy gorgeous photographs of a WHS by professionals and amatuers alike</li>
                </ul>
                Providing such functionalities listed above has been possible through JavaScript implementation of the following APIs -
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/" target="_blank">Google API</a> for Google Maps</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/" target="_blank">Flickr API</a> for photographs on Google Maps infoWindows</li>
                    <li><a href="http://developers.500px.com/" target="_blank">500px API</a> for photographs of WHS</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page" target="_blank">MediaWiki API </a>for retreival of basic information about a WHS from Wikipedia</li>
                </ul>
                A thorough technical explanation of implementation of these APIs is given <a href="#">here</a> in the project documentation.

            </div>
            <div class="doc-subheading">Software platform</div>
            <div class="doc-text">This website is purely based on HTML/CSS. All client side logic has been implemented using jQuery.
                This website does not require the use of server side code, nor does it call any web services. Therefore, I have avoided 
                using .NET specific technologies provided by ASP.NET. <br /><br />
                The data presented on this web site comes from two sources - APIs and a 'flat-file'. Photos &amp; information on WHS sites come 
                from respective APIs. Their location information required by Google Maps to display them comes from a text file (flat-file). Specific 
                tag-information, necessary to fetch relevant information from Flickr, 500px and Wikipedia, are also stored in this text-file.<br /><br />
                During my discussion with Prof. Rasala about the project, I was recommended to use a text file for storing such data instead of 
                using a database. The reasons for that are as follows - 
                <ul>
                    <li>Such data <strong>is not</strong> relational by nature, so no primary key or foreign key is required</li>
                    <li>Data volume is not humongous, and therefore can be easily managed</li>
                    <li>Saves unnecessary overhead in accessing the database on server, and maintaing a connection with it, etc</li>
                    <li>Avoids use of server access when it is quite unnecessary</li>
                    <li>Very easy to add/remove records</li>
                    <li>It is easy to parse data on text files using the built-in AJAX capability of jQuery</li>
                </ul>
                A detailed description of how data is arranged in the text file and how I access it using jQuery is given <a href="#">here</a> in the project documentation.
            </div>
            <div class="doc-subheading">Browser compatibility</div>
            <div class="doc-text"><p>This website works well across latest versions of all major browsers - IE9, Mozilla Firefox & Google Chrome.</p></div>
            <div class="doc-subheading">Made for iPhone</div>
            <div class="doc-text">This website runs well on computer screens. Apart from that, I have ensured a beautiful experience on the iPhone. I have used CSS media queries 
                to change the layout and styles of elements so that the iPhone user is focused on the content, and does not have to worry about usability and size of elements.
            </div>
            <div class="doc-subheading">Copyright information</div>
            <div class="doc-text">All photographs of World Heritage sites, including those on the <a href="../home.html" target="_blank">home page</a> fading slideshow, belong to the photographers who posted
                their work on <a href="http://www.flickr.com" target="_blank">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://www.500px.com" target="_blank">500px</a>.

            <div class="doc-text">I want to take this opportunity to thank <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/rasala/" target="_blank">Professor Richard Rasala</a> for his guidance and valuable insights that helped me develop my ideas for the website, and his various

                a web API using jQuery. Last, but not the least, I want to thank <a href=http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/anjusv target="_blank"/>Anju Sreevalsan</a>, my assigned TA for the course, for helping me debug the various experiments I developed during the course, and for providing her valuable insights and
